 /* BMI Calculator Advanced (IF/ELSE)
Previously, we've created a function that is able to calculate the BMI. But once we get a result, we will want to tell the user what the number means.

Write a function that outputs (returns) a different message depending on the BMI.

/* Leap Year
Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February 
his is how to work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:

A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4 ;

except if that year is also evenly divisible by 100;

unless that year is also evenly divisible by 400.

Write a function that takes a year as an input and outputs whether it is a leap year or not.

Fibonacci Generator
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, ...
Create a function where you can call it by writing the code: fibonacciGenerator (n) Where n is the number of items in the sequence. So I should be able to call: fibonacciGenerator(3) and get [0,1,1] as the output.
