# 🌐 Full-Stack Web Development Journey

This repository tracks my progress through the **Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp** by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy.

It includes all the projects, mini-apps, notes, and experiments I create along the way as I learn full-stack development from scratch.
